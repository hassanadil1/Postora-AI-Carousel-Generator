#Project Overview

We're already off to a strong start—having bullet points, design presets, and brand customization is huge. From here, your next moves should be about turning that structured input into polished visual output. Here’s a step-by-step plan to move forward:

1. Build a Carousel Layout Engine
You need a way to convert:

Bullet points

Design preset

Brand colors

Logo

…into a visual slide.

How:

Create 1–2 HTML/CSS templates per design preset (playful, funky, professional).

Use CSS variables or Tailwind to dynamically apply brand colors and fonts.

Reserve layout slots for:

Slide heading/subheading

Bullet points (1–3 max)

Logo (usually bottom corner or top right)

2. Automate Design Assembly
When bullet points are generated, build a function that:

Splits them into slides (based on type/priority).

Assigns each slide to the corresponding HTML layout.

Applies the user’s design preset and brand colors.

Tools you can use:

For web rendering: React + Tailwind

For server-side image export: Puppeteer (headless Chrome), html2image, or Playwright

For live preview: use <div>-based slides with a "preview mode"

3. Integrate the Logo
Use the uploaded logo and:

Resize and place it consistently across slides.

Add logic to optionally remove the background or fit it into a badge-style element (e.g., using remove.bg API or similar if needed).

4. Add Navigation and Export
Let users:

Preview all slides

Reorder slides if needed

Export as:

A ZIP of PNGs

A shareable PDF

Or even directly post to LinkedIn via API later

5. Optional but Nice-to-Have
Typography pairing logic: Recommend good font combos for each preset.

Image suggestions: Use OpenAI or Unsplash API to suggest background images.

Content preview: Highlight how it would appear on LinkedIn in-feed.
